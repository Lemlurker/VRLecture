# VRLecture Theatre
The world is primarily for the purpose of replacing the current dated lecture room format. 
At least initially a more classical approach would be utilised to make the transition to 
virtual lectures more seamless but with time a more blended learning space can be developed 
that makes use of the ability of a virtual environment to twist the volume and space available.
With this environment the basics are a simple multi tier lecture theatre with a single set of
centre steps, each tier has their own desk space in front and in the centre of the lecture area 
there is a lecture stand and a virtual rendition of the inside of a turbojet engine. This is 
there to illustrate the potential education advantages of a 3d virtual learning space in terms 
of displaying content vs a traditional 2d space used currently. Secondary to this is a set of
two projector slides used to show the legacy content to enable the transition to virtual learning
smoother as there will be no necessity for a total rewrite of the content, instead the current 
content can be augmented with newer virtual content. 

How too Install
  download the Build.zip from the repository, unzip into a location of your choosing, 
  open the folder and double click LectureRoom.exe. the program will run and hook into either oculus or
  steam SDK automatically.
